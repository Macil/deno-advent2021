# deno-advent2021

This is a partial set of solutions to
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021, using Deno and Typescript.

## Usage

You must have [aocd](https://github.com/Macil/aocd/) installed and have set the
session cookie with it:

```
aocd set-cookie COOKIE_VALUE_HERE
```

Then you can run any day's challenge to see the answer:

```
deno run -A day_1.ts
```

You can run all tests with `deno task test`, or you can run an individual test
by clicking the play button next to it inside of Visual Studio Code.
